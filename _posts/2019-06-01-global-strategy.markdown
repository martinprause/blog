The context of “Global Strategy” is the strategic expansion of a globally oriented and publicly listed technology company. The product of interest is a wearable smart device – “the tracker” – for tracking and monitoring the wearer’s daily activities, such as exercises, sleep, nutrients, etc. Your team will take on the role of the Board of Executive Directors. It is your task to define and implement the strategic expansion of the company into new markets.
At the beginning of the game customers perceive your product and the products offered by the competition as identical. For their purchase decisions price is the only differentiator. To free yourself from pure price competition you want to differentiate away from the competition by making strategic and tactical investments into product market expansion. Equipped with a sound budget for business expansion you can enter different European regions and market segments to aim for the highest cumulative profits and the best corresponding sound market entry performance.
