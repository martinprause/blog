StratChal is a serious simulation game that combines management theories with practice. The simulation implements a realistic model of the 3D printer industry. The market consists of several manufacturing firms producing 3D printers in a large B2C and a smaller B2B market. A group of participants takes the perspective of a company and maneuvers it, in competition with other groups (companies), through multiple periods by making decisions in various functional business areas. The simulation game combines theories from Strategic Management, Procurement, Supply Chain Management, Marketing, Organizational Behaviour, Economics and Financing in an interactive tool.
